##  How Many Items Are Ordered From Each Aisle?
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n, .desc = FALSE)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~aisle,
    y = ~n,
    color = ~aisle,
    type = "bar"
  )
```

## Is There A Correlation Between Order Day of Week and Days Since Prior Order?
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  select(order_id, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  mutate(order_dow = case_when(
      order_dow == "0" ~ "Sunday",
      order_dow == "1" ~ "Monday",
      order_dow == "2" ~ "Tuesday",
      order_dow == "3" ~ "Wednesday",
      order_dow == "4" ~ "Thursday",
      order_dow == "5" ~ "Friday",
      order_dow == "6" ~ "Saturday")
    ) %>% 
  group_by(order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(avg_days = mean(days_since_prior_order)) %>% 
  mutate(forcats::fct_reorder(order_dow, c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~order_dow,
    y = ~avg_days,
    type = "scatter", 
    mode = "markers")
```
